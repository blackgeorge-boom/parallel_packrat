# Improving the efficiency of packrat parsing

* The largest part of the thesis is devoted to parallelizing the [packrat parsing](https://bford.info/packrat/) algorithm.
* Also, other techniques are implemented and examined, like [packrat parsing with elastic sliding window](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281806392_Packrat_Parsing_with_Elastic_Sliding_Window).
