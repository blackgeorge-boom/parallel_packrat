This is a code skeleton for the Assignment #4 of the Parallel Processing Systems
course. The code is fully functional as it is now, meaning you can compile and
run it without a problem. The performance of the GPU kernels are of course
bogus, since they currently do nothing. This is what you should do! :-)

The structure of the repository is as follows:

    dmv-skeleton/
    | -- common/
    | -- cuda/
    | -- opencl/

You can choose to complete the CUDA or OpenCL implementation, or you can even
do both! The code has some `FILLME:' annotations to denote the parts where you
have to fill in some code. Of course, you can do whatever other magic you like,
but use the same timing operations, in order to have a common baseline for
measuring the performance.

Before starting filling up the necessary GPU code, do the following three things
first:

(a) Run `make help' to see what options the Makefile supports.

(b) Run `make all' to compile the project.

(c) Run `./cuda/dmv_main' or `./opencl/dmv_main' to get a help message of what
    the program expects from you. Play a bit to get the feeling.

Now, you can inspect the code and get started. The 'common/' subdirectory
includes some utilities that are shared for both implementations. The code of
the '/cuda' and '/opencl' subdirectories is structured in four parts:

(a) The main program (dmv_main.c/cu), which is responsible for printing the
    messages you 've just seen, setting up the data structures and
    calling/measuring the performance of the kernels (CPU and GPU ones).

(b) The CPU kernels (dmv.c), which also holds all the necessary algebra stuff
    (matrix + vector operations).

(c) The GPU kernels (dmv_gpu.cu/cl), which you must fill.

(d) Utility functions (the rest of the files), which are responsible for making
    the code readable.

Finally, have a look in the `run_dmv.sh' script before submitting jobs to the
lab's GPU machines.
